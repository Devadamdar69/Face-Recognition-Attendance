# Face Recognition and Attendance System

This project implements a face recognition and attendance system using OpenCV, NumPy, and face_recognition libraries in Python. It captures images from a webcam, recognizes faces, and marks attendance in a CSV file.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- OpenCV
- NumPy
- face_recognition

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy face-recognition
```

This project serves as a foundational model, upon which I plan to implement a feature to verify whether the person detected by the facial recognition is genuine or fraudulent.
